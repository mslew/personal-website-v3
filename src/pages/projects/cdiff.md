Research project started in June 2022. This is an Agent-Based model of *C. difficile* developed in NetLogo. The research has been conducted with a partner and two faculty advisors. I have presented the research at the Mathematical Association of America's [MathFest](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/students/undergrad/PosterSess22%20%282%29.pdf) in Philadelphia, PA and the [Symposium on Biomathematics](https://ir.library.illinoisstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1625&context=beer) and Ecology Education and Research at Illinois State University. I have won [The Janet L. Andersen Award](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/biosigmaa/andersen_prize) for Undergraduate Research in Mathematical or Computational Biology, and the Undergraduate Student Poster Session [Outstanding Poster Award](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/students/undergrad/2022%20Outstanding%20Posters%20-%20FINAL.pdf) at MathFest. Paper coming soon!
